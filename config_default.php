## Mantis BT Config
# Mantis is simple to configure as it has complete API support for all needed features.
$username = "user";
$password = "";
$location = "http://example.com/mantisbt/api/soap/mantisconnect.php";

    "password" => $password,

## Redmine Config
# Redmine needs alot of help, since only core APIs are exposed. Remember that you will
# need to reconfigure mtkb if you make changes in Redmine.
$username = "user";
$password = "";
$location = "http://example.com/redmine";
$wsdlfile = $location."?wsdl";

# You will probably need to tailor these. Redmine has no clean API for grabbing these and
# refuse to solve this in any other substandard way for the sake of this project. Have a
# look at how Mantis does the API thing. Personally I would just can Redmine just because
# it has a really poor API. The german example below doesn't make this whole thing any
# nicer, but you'll have to live with it since that is what i need right now.
